#Notes

* To push a branch to a remote (as a branch), use `git push -u` for initial push.

Or not:

```
$ git push -u
fatal: The current branch dev has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin dev
```

So very nice when the documentation doesn't match reality.  Not in the least bit frustrating.
